Since CodeIgniter is not developed for a long while and i really like this Framework so i decided to continue the journey of this awesome Framework and give it a step forward on my own.\r\n\r\nCodeIgniter is really awesome but the problem is about development, PHP getting much better everyday and CodeIgniter still worry about PHP4 where actually it's like no one now use PHP4, so my main aim is to move CodeIgniter forward to take a benifit of new features of PHP5.\r\n\r\n##Some Targets :\r\n\r\n1 - Implement Namespaces <br />\r\n2 - Develop the Loader <br />\r\n3 - Provide a better 'View' handling, and add Multi-Themes system <br />\r\n4 - Add more libraries to the core <br />\r\n5 - Allow the coder to have more control of his application <br />\r\n6 - Develop Hooks System since it's very poor <br />\r\n7 - Provide a better Documentation <br />\r\nand much more, in general i want it to be a very good choice for large projects not only small or regular ones\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
